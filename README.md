When searching for the peregrine falcon, the fastest bird on the planet, i found this picture of side view of falcon and the famous bomber B-2. 
The peregrine falcon can reach a top speed of 390kmh (according to google). It has a mass of 0.7-1.5kg, a length of 34-58cms and and a wingspan of 74-120cm. When diving, this bird of prey can reach the top speed  due to his bullet shape body. When this bird is about to reach the next victim, it opens the wings to slow down and increase the gliding ability.

The Peregrine Falcon Glider

This concept aims to mimic some of the key features of the peregrine in a rc object and try to reach the top speed of the living animal.
Key features of this RC "Glider":
- Weight
- Length
- Wingspan
- pivoting wings (diving and gliding mode)
- body shape
